# Sakila DVD Rental Database Investigation

Investigate a DVD Rental database, using SQL queries and Excel visualisation

## Summary

The Sakila DVD Rental database holds fictional information about a company that rents movie DVDs. In this project, I queried the Sakila DVD Rental database using SQL to answer the following questions:

1. Was there a relationship between count of family-friendly rental orders and overall rent duration quartile?
2. How did the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for?
3. How much did the top 10 customers pay per month in 2007?
4. How did the top 10 customersâ€™ spending vary each month in 2007

Query results were visualised using Excel.
